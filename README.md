# GB-gammon

This repository holds my re-implementation of Gerry Tesauro's TD-gammon, which I worked on largely in May of 2020 as a quarantine self-edification project. To that end, I didn't use packages for the neural net, the game itself, or for training, which makes the final product fairly slow, as it's mostly written in stock python. (I did use NumPy arrays in the neural net.)
